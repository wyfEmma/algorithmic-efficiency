The MLCommons‚Ñ¢ **AlgoPerf: Training Algorithms benchmark** is designed to find **training algorithms that can train neural networks faster** by rigorously measuring how quickly they reach a specific performance target across a diverse set of deep learning workloads.

When training neural nets, practitioners face many critical yet often opaque decisions: What optimizer to choose? How should its learning rate be tuned? What learning rate schedule should be used? These choices can make or break training, yet the community has lacked a clear, standardized way to identify the state of the art.
Unlike benchmarks focused on hardware or model architecture, AlgoPerf isolates the **training algorithm** itself, which includes the optimizer, regularization, data selection, and hyperparameters like the learning rate schedule. By standardizing the benchmark process, AlgoPerf offers a meaningful apples-to-apples comparison of training algorithms and follows the following **key principles**:

- üéØ **Fixed Target, Model & Hardware:** Submitted training algorithms must train a set of [**fixed models**](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#workloads) to a pre-defined validation performance target as fast as possible. All submissions use the same model architecture and are run on the same [**standardized hardware**](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#benchmarking-hardware) (8x NVIDIA V100 GPUs). This isolates the training algorithm's performance and allows a fair apples-to-apples comparison.
- ‚è±Ô∏è **Time-To-Result:** Submissions are evaluated based on the total wall-clock time required to reach the target, rewarding practical and efficient algorithms.
- üß† **Diverse Workloads:** The benchmark includes [**8 diverse deep learning workloads**](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#workloads) across domains like image classification, speech recognition, and machine translation. A submission's score is computed by aggregating its performance, using [**performance profiles**](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#benchmark-score-using-performance-profiles), across all workloads to ensure general-purpose algorithms.
- üì¶ **Fully-Specified Algorithms:** Submissions must be complete procedures and thus hyperparameter tuning is treated as part of the algorithm. Submissions can either provide a search space for automated tuning ([**External tuning ruleset**](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#external-tuning-ruleset)) or be hyperparameter-free ([**Self-tuning ruleset**](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md#self-tuning-ruleset)) with any tuning done automatically and "on the clock". This measures an algorithm's _total_ practical cost and provides practitioners with a complete method, eliminating the guesswork of how to apply it.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> **We have moved to a rolling leaderboard!**
> We invite you to submit your algorithm for evaluation, see our [**How to Submit**](#how-to-submit) section and the [**submission repository**](https://github.com/mlcommons/submissions_algorithms). The working group will review your submission and, if selected, run it on our hardware and add your results to the official [**AlgoPerf Leaderboard**](https://github.com/mlcommons/submissions_algorithms). **Note: we are currently focusing our efforts on the self-tuning leaderboard to strengthen its competitiveness.**

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to run a baseline algorithm and start developing your own submission.
A more detailed guide can be found in the [**Getting Started**](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) document.
If you run into any issues, please feel free to contact us.
Either [**file an issue**](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/issues), ask a question on [**our Discord**](https://discord.gg/5FPXK7SMt6) or [**join our weekly meetings**](https://mlcommons.org/en/groups/research-algorithms/).

### Installation

We recommend using the provided [**Docker container**](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md#docker) to ensure a reproducible environment similar to our scoring environment.
Alternatively, you can install the package and its dependencies in a Python virtual environment.
Both options are described in more detail in the [**Getting Started**](/docs/GETTING_STARTED.md) document.

_TL;DR Install JAX version for GPU (with workload dependencies):_

```bash
pip3 install -e '.[pytorch_cpu,jax_gpu,full]' --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cpu
```

_TL;DR Install PyTorch version for GPU (with workload dependencies):_

```bash
pip3 install -e '.[jax_cpu,pytorch_gpu,full]'
```

### Run a Workload

Use the `submission_runner.py` to run an experiment, i.e., train a workload using a specific training algorithm.
Here's how to run the AdamW baseline on the `mnist` workload.

_TL;DR: Running a JAX workload:_

```bash
python3 submission_runner.py \
    --framework=jax \
    --workload=mnist \
    --experiment_dir=$HOME/experiments \
    --experiment_name=my_first_experiment \
    --submission_path=algorithms/archived_paper_baselines/adamw/jax/submission.py \
    --tuning_search_space=algorithms/archived_paper_baselines/adamw/tuning_search_space.json
```

_TL;DR: Running a PyTorch workload:_

```bash
python3 submission_runner.py \
    --framework=pytorch \
    --workload=mnist \
    --experiment_dir=$HOME/experiments \
    --experiment_name=my_first_experiment \
    --submission_path=algorithms/archived_paper_baselines/adamw/pytorch/submission.py \
    --tuning_search_space=algorithms/archived_paper_baselines/adamw/tuning_search_space.json
```

## Releases & Roadmap

The AlgoPerf benchmark is an actively evolving project designed to keep pace with the rapidly changing field of machine learning. To ensure clarity and reproducibility, we have adopted a unified versioning system: codebase, rules, and leaderboard all share the same `Major.Minor` version. `Patch` versions may differ for minor updates.
All results produced under the same `Major.Minor` version are comparable, making it easy to cite "`AlgoPerf v0.X`" and know exactly which set of rules, code, and submissions are being referenced.

Here is an overview of our key releases and the future roadmap. For a detailed list of changes in each release, see our [**Changelog**](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

- `v0.5` - Inaugural Competition <br> The benchmark as it was run for the first AlgoPerf competition in 2024. The key findings and analysis from this competition are detailed in our [**ICLR 2025 Results Paper**](https://openreview.net/forum?id=CtM5xjRSfm). It serves as a historical reference.
  - **Leaderboard:** Archived at [**AlgoPerf v0.5 Leaderboard**](https://github.com/mlcommons/submissions_algorithms/tree/main/previous_leaderboards/algoperf_v05).
  - **Rules:** The rules are archived at the [**AlgoPerf v0.5 Documentation**](https://github.com/mlcommons/algorithmic-efficiency/blob/v0.5.0/DOCUMENTATION.md).
- `v0.6` - **Current Version** <br> The active and recommended version of the benchmark. It is an improved and streamlined version that fixes important bugs and modifying the benchmarking protocol based on the lessons learned from the competition. **This is the recommended version for all new submissions.**

  - **Key Changes:** (see the [Changelog](/docs/CHANGELOG.md) for details, including links to discussions on rule changes.)
    - A rolling leaderboard now allows for continuous submissions and updates.
    - Reduced computational cost via removing held-out workloads, 3 repetition studies (down from 5), and adjusted runtime budgets.
    - Includes important bug fixes (e.g., batch norm) and API improvements (e.g., `prepare_for_eval` function).
    - Migrating from `pmap` to `jit` in JAX for better performance and scalability.
  - **Leaderboard:** The active (but currently limited) leaderboard can be found at [**AlgoPerf v0.6 Leaderboard**](https://github.com/mlcommons/submissions_algorithms).
  - **Rules:** For the current set of rules see [**AlgoPerf v0.6 Documentation**](/docs/DOCUMENTATION.md).

> üèóÔ∏è `v1.0` (Future) - Planned Long-Term Support Release <br> This will be the next major release of the benchmark and a "long-term support" version, with the following **anticipated features:**
>
> - Adding a new language model (LM) workload.
> - Stronger baselines, especially for the self-tuning leaderboard.

## Training Algorithm Collection

This repository also provides a collection of implemented training algorithms with different purposes. These include [**submission templates**](./algorithms/template), [**development examples**](./algorithms/development_algorithms), [**target-setting algorithms**](./algorithms/target_setting_algorithms), [**historical baselines**](./algorithms/archived_paper_baselines), and [**current baselines**](./algorithms/baselines). For a detailed overview of these algorithms and their organization, please refer to the [`algorithms/README.md`](./algorithms/README.md) file. You can also find all benchmark submissions and their results on the official [**Leaderboard**](https://github.com/mlcommons/submissions_algorithms).
