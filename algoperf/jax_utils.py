  """Create a dropout layer.
  Forked from
  https://flax-linen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/_modules/flax/linen/stochastic.html#Dropout.
  The reference dropout implementation is modified support changes
  to dropout rate during  training by:
  1) adding rate argument to the __call__ method.
  2) removing the if-else condition to check for edge cases, which
  will trigger a recompile for jitted code.

  .. note::
    When using :meth:`Module.apply() <flax.linen.Module.apply>`, make sure
    to include an RNG seed named ``'dropout'``. Dropout isn't necessary for
    variable initialization.

  Example usage::

    >>> import flax.linen as nn
    >>> import jax, jax.numpy as jnp

    >>> class MLP(nn.Module):
    ...   @nn.compact
    ...   def __call__(self, x, train):
    ...     x = nn.Dense(4)(x)
    ...     x = nn.Dropout(0.5, deterministic=not train)(x)
    ...     return x

    >>> model = MLP()
    >>> x = jnp.ones((1, 3))
    >>> variables = model.init(jax.random.key(0), x, train=False) # don't use dropout
    >>> model.apply(variables, x, train=False) # don't use dropout
    Array([[-0.17875527,  1.6255447 , -1.2431065 , -0.02554005]], dtype=float32)

    broadcast_dims: dimensions that will share the same dropout mask
    deterministic: if false the inputs are scaled by ``1 / (1 - rate)``
      and masked, whereas if true, no mask is applied and the inputs are
      returned as is.
    rng_collection: the rng collection name to use when requesting an rng
      key.
