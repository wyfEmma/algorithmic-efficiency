  """Flips a sequence of inputs along the time dimension.

  This function can be used to prepare inputs for the reverse direction of a
  bidirectional LSTM. It solves the issue that, when naively flipping multiple
  padded sequences stored in a matrix, the first elements would be padding
  values for those sequences that were padded. This function keeps the padding
  at the end, while flipping the rest of the elements.

  Example:
  ```python
  inputs = [[1, 0, 0],
            [2, 3, 0]
            [4, 5, 6]]
  lengths = [1, 2, 3]
